# Hiring

It is Klira's policy to be conservative with hiring, if there is any
non-trivial doubt as to the ability of a candidate to fulfill the
requirements of a role, the hiring committee must recommend against
making an offer.

Within the Klira team no incentives for providing hiring
recommendations will be made. We bring on new team members because we
believe that it is the right thing to do, not because you want to earn
a bonus.

Additionally start dates must be set such that at more than 25% of a
department is employed onboarding new hires, unless the size of the
department hiring is two or fewer.

## Hiring process

1. Upon finding a possible candidate, any team-member may invite them
   to a meeting. The referring team member should invite 2-3 other
   team members to the meeting, having preference for the person who
   would be considered the candidates employer if they were to work at
   Klira and appropriate C-level executives/founders. This group form
   the hiring committee.
2. At the first meeting team-members should tell the candidate about
   the goals of the company, and how we aim to get there. Additionally
   the current situation of the candidate and how it fits with our
   plans should be discussed. The aim of the meeting is to establish a
   relationship with Klira, at provide a starting point for more
   concrete discussions.
3. After the first meeting member may, if deemed appropriate for purposes
   of fairness and objectivity, be replaced by another team
   member. The hiring committee then decides whether to the next
   phase, reject the candidate, or defer the process to a later
   time. The hiring committee then informs the candidate of their
   decision.
4. If the committee decides to move on the next phase, a deeper
   interview should take place, doing this meeting in a conference
   room is recommended. This interview should aims to determine if the
   applicant's skills are right for the role being considered, as well
   as practical factors relevant to hiring them.
5. After this meeting the hiring committee decides whether to make a
   hiring recommendation.
6. If such a recommendation is made the hiring executives then
   present an offer letter to the candidate and invite the candidate
   to sign the employment agreement.

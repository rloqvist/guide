# Meetings

In addition to the [standup meetings](./standup.md) we have a number
of scheduled and unscheduled meetings. The preferred meeting day for
meetings, internal and external are Mondays. In general when booking
meetings always suggest a time falling on a Monday. If you can't find
a meeting time on a Monday try to book either a lunch meeting or a
dinner meeting. We have some regular meetings, described below which
we organize on schedule.

## Staff meetings

Every fourth Monday of the month, during Q1, Q2, Q4, a staff meeting
is held. The purpose of the staff meeting for everyone to share
information they feel is important. If you feel that something should
be covered at the meeting, please write a public message in Slack.

## 1 on 1

Every week on Monday, during Q1, Q2, Q4, we organize one on one
meetings. The point of the 1on1 meetings is to both improve individual
performance and improve communication within the team.
